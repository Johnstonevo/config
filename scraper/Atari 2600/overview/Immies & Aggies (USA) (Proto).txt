Your shooter can fire in 8 directions. Blast the &quot;immies&quot; at the top of the screen that are the same color as the changing block in the center a the top. The smaller and higher they are, the more points you get! If you hit the wrong color and equal number of points are subtracted. Careful! Some colors are very similar. Look out! Blue aggies are attacking you from each side. Get 'em -- They're worth 100 points each in round one, then 200, etc. (according to how many small blue blocks are above the large, changing one). The colored bars at the top, on each side are just decoration.
