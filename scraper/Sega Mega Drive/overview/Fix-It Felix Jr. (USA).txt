Fix-It Felis is Niceland's hammer-wielding maintenance man who's beloved by all. When he is not busy fixin' all of Ralph's wreckin', this gold-medal-winning good guy is being showered with kisses, praise and pies from his tenants. Hardwired for niceness, anything other than being "The Good Guy" just doesn't compute. Unfortunately for Niceland's tenants Wreck-It Ralph is at it again. Smashing anything he can get his gigantic paws on! So it's up to Felix once more to fix all the damage and save the day!
