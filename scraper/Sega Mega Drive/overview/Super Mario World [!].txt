Super Mario World 64 is a pirated port of the SNES Super Mario World, made for the Mega Drive/Genesis by an unknown developer, at an unknown date (but presumably some time after the original release of Super Mario 64, in 1996). Super Mario World 64 was probably created by the same people who created Super Donkey Kong 99 (A bootleg original Donkey Kong Country game for the Sega Genesis).
