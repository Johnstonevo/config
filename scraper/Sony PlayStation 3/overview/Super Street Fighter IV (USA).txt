Super Street Fighter IV (スーパーストリートファイター IV Sūpā Sutorīto Faitā Fō?) is a 2010 fighting game produced by Capcom. It is an updated version of Street Fighter IV and has been said to mark the definitive end of the Street Fighter IV series.[1] Having been deemed as too large an update to be deployed as DLC, the game was made into a standalone title, but given a lower price than that of a full retail game.[2] It was released in April 2010 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.[3] Super Street Fighter IV: 3D Edition was released as one of the launch titles for the Nintendo 3DS, with 3D functionality, on February 26, 2011, in Japan.[4] The game has sold 1.9 million units worldwide,[5] while the 3D Edition for the 3DS has sold an additional 1.1 million units worldwide.[5]
