The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Master Quest is a reworked version of the original Ocarina of Time for the Nintendo 64. Master Quest contains largely the same content as the original Ocarina of Time, but with redesigned, more difficult dungeons akin to a Second Quest.\n\nMaster Quest was available on a special bonus disc that also contained the original Ocarina of Time. This disc was given out in limited quantities with preorders of The Wind Waker. Additionally, it was sold packaged with The Wind Waker in some regions. It is also available as a mode in Ocarina of Time 3D after first completing the regular game.
