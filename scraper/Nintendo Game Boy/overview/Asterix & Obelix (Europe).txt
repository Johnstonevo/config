Caesar has erected a new barricade around the village of the indomitable gauls, to keep them trapped inside. Join Asterix and Obelix and travel across the Roman Empire. Here you will enter a bullfight, participate in a rugby match, and even take part in the Olympic Games. Bring a souvenir from each country you visit, in order to prove to Caesar that the Gauls are the strongest heroes.
