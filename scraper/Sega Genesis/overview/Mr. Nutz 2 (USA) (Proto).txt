Mr. Nutz: Hoppin' Mad, also known as Mr. Nutz 2 is a "sequel" to Mr. Nutz, developed by Neon Software and published by Ocean Software for the Commodore Amiga in 1994. It was due to be ported to the Sega Mega Drive, however this port was cancelled for unknown reasons. Had it been released, it would have arrived in Europe around April of 1995. Like its predecessor, no North American or Japanese Mega Drive versions were planned.
