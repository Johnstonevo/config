Stone Protectors is an unreleased Sega Mega Drive beat-'em-up game developed by Eurocom based on the cartoon series with the same name. It saw a release for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1994, and a port to the Mega Drive was due to be published by VIC Tokai, but was cancelled for unknown reasons. The game was very close to completion before being axed, so much so that it had even obtained an ESRB rating.A fully working prototype of the Mega Drive version was unearthed in 2010.
