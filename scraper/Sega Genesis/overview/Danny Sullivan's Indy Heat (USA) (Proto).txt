Danny Sullivan's Indy Heat is a 1991 arcade racing game developed and published in the arcades by Leland Corporation. It is based on a three-player arcade game of the same title. It starred American IndyCar driver Danny Sullivan, and featured the tracks of the CART series of the early 1990s.  Indy Heat featured four-player capability, and was similar in gameplay to Super Off Road. Players earned money based on their race finishing positions, which was spent on improving their car. The race season culminated with the Tradewest Speed Bowl, which loosely resembled the Indianapolis 500.  A version of the game was also completed and licensed by Tradewest for the Sega Genesis but the release was delayed until 25 July 2011, in a total of 50 copies have been produced for the Sega Genesis, complete with case, cartridge and cover art.
