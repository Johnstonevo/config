The game is composed of four stages based off of the original PlayStation game. All of the graphics try to copy the original game, though are downgraded with lots of detail missing such as the whole forest atmosphere of the first level. Also, a few enemies use sprites from either Aladdin for the SNES, or the Mega Drive pirate of the same game.The first three stages are platform based, while the final fourth stage is more like a shooter where you ride Pegasus. Each stage ends with a boss that must be defeated in order to advance.
