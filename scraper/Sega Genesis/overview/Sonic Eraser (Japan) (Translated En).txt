Sonic Eraser (ソニックイレイザー) is a 1991 puzzle game that was downloadable for players that had Sega Game Toshokan, an online game downloading service for the Sega Mega Drive in Japan. Because the service is now long defunct, the game was unknown to much of the Sonic community for a time. The game was later released in 2004 on Sega of Japan's website, and it received more widespread attention as it was noticed by English-speaking Sonic fans this time around.
