In this sequel to Putty, the Wizard's peoples have invaded Putty land, and it's up to you to head to the Wizard city of Klud and free your many POWs. The gameplay has less of a puzzle element than the original, and is more of a standard platform game - to whatever extent a game in which you can become an all-conquering Terminator Putty, must face pups throwing grenades at you, and can use Uncle Ted to play a tune to distract enemies can be seen as a 'standard' example of anything.
