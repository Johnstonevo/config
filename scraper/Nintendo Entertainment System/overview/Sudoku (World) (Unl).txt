From creator Al Bailey, Sudoku 2007 is an NES version of the classic Sudoku logic puzzle. Start by selecting a difficulty level or puzzle number. Easy to use controls allow you to quickly enter numbers into the puzzle grid. When you think you have all of the numbers in the correct place, hit start to evaluate. If everything is correct you move on, but if there is an error you get a time penalty and an indication of how many numbers are out of place.
