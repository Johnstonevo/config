Wait and See! is a platform game developed by Dragon Co.. The game has Nu, pogodi! (a famous Russian series of theatrical shorts similar to Tom and Jerry) as an alternate title; however, apart from this and one of the cartridge labels, it has nothing to do with the actual cartoon. The phrase "Nu, pogodi!" is more closely translated as "Well, Just you wait!" instead of "Wait and see!".
