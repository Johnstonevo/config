The game is a recreation of the original Boogerman, but is considerably less faithful than Boogerman II: The Final Adventure, with a mixed-up level order and severely limited abilities for the player, which is compensated for by providing infinite ammo.Like many of Super Game's other bootlegs, this game has no ending; after the player defeats the third boss, the game merely resets.
