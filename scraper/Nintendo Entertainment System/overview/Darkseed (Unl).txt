Dark Seed is a psychological horror point-and-click adventure game developed and published by Cyberdreams in 1992. It exhibits a normal world and a dark world counterpart, which is based on the artwork by H. R. Giger. It was one of the first point-and-click adventure games to use high-resolution (640 Ã— 350 pixels) graphics, to Giger's demand. A sequel, Dark Seed II, was released in 1995.
