Super Mario World is a bootleg port of the SNES launch title of the same name, developed by Hummer Team and released in 1995. This is one of the more well-known examples of pirate ports to the NES, as it comparatively manages to retain most of the elements that defined the SNES original without sacrificing too much quality.
