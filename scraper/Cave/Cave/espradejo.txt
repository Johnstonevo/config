For this reason, an artificial island, aptly named tokyo-2, is created just offshore, thanks to the support of the shady "yaksa" corporation, led by elusive billionaire garra ono, whose ties with the modern incarnation of yakuza have not been proven. Another source of instability is given by the rising number of humans exhibiting extrasensory perception, the so-called espers, who are constantly hunted down by the japanese police force. Unknown to everyone, garra herself is an extremely powerful esper, bent on using her influence over the government and military to replace every living being in the city with clones (disturbingly enough, these espers take the form of a 10 years old girl, named "alice" and implied to originate from garra's own dna). Just as her plans begin to unfold, three children are forced to take action, each one for his or her own personal motives.the story takes place in december, during a 24-hour arc; each character has a specific stage which initiates his or her storyline, culminating with the final encounter.
