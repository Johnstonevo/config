Progear is a 2D horizontal scrolling arcade shooter. It's Cave's only side scrolling shmup until Deathsmiles in 2007. The game basically follows the bullet hell style - many bullets to dodge and enemies to kill, plus very big bosses at the end of each level. A player can choose out of five kids (two male pilots and three female gunners), which affects the shooting. The scoring is influenced by a system based on rings/gems, generated when enemies are destroyed. The game's art design is steampunk based.
