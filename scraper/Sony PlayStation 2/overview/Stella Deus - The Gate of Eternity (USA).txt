Stella Deus is a tactical RPG of Japanese origin. It follows the party-based conventions of genre landmarks such as Final Fantasy Tactics, Ogre Battle, or Hoshigami: Ruining Blue Earth, but features realistically rendered characters and rich, 3D environments. The game's sophisticated, philosophy-infused storyline involves an evil mist, appropriately known as the "Miasma," which has gradually covered the fantasy-style game world, bringing death and despair. Players lead a team of adventures who seek to cleanse the world of the cursed fog, though each for his or her own reason, and hoping to reach this shared goal by a different means.
