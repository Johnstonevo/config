Shinobido Imashime is a ninja game, resembling Tenchu at first glance. You play as a black-clad ninja called Gou, also known as The Raven. Gou has lost his memory, and he's not sure why he's fighting. Providing some clue to his exploits are Zaji, a ninja who wears an eye patch, and a mysterious "kunoichi" female ninja, whose name has not been revealed. Both Gou and Zaji have the same emblem on their belt, with the female ninja having a similar shape tattooed on her left leg. Real physics seems to be the big selling point for this game. The game uses a real physics engine which handles the movement of all objects, promising added realism. You'll be able to stack up objects in order to form a stepping ground for scaling a tall wall. Kill an enemy, and when he falls, his position will reflect the shape of the ground beneath him, even if that means hanging over a ledge and slowly falling off.
