This sequel to the Square-Enix action game continues the multifaceted air and ground combat of the original. Drakengard 2 (known as Drag On Dragoon in Japan) takes place 18 years after the events of the original. The whereabouts of the original's hero, Caim, are unknown to anyone. A new young knight called Nowe serves as the playable main character. Together with his dragon, Legna, Nowe takes part in land and air-based battles, just like in the original, albeit with more refined gameplay. The kill-all mechanics and upgradable weapons of the original return with this title, with the promise of faster action. While on the ground, the game now lets you change freely between characters, with no limit. You'll want to switch characters in order to best match the enemy at hand. Other additions include new mega attacks while airborne.
