Survival horror and science fiction come together in the sequel to Galerians. In Galerians: Ash, you reprise the role of Rion as he fights the Last Galerians and their evil leader Ash, who wants to destroy all organic life on Earth. Joined once again by Lilia, you must battle your enemies with all-new psychic attacks and neural enhancers across new and expansive environments. In this game, a strong psyche, puzzle-solving skills, and quick reflexes are most valuable to success.
