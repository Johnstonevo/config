Generation 1 is effectively a remake of the original 1987 Sega Master System release of Phantasy Star. Though extremely similar to the original, it offers an updated battle system (similar to Phantasy Star II/Phantasy Star IV), improved graphics, a new soundtrack and various gameplay tweaks to bring it in line with more modern RPGs.
