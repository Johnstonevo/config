Shadow of Memories (Shadow of Destiny in North America) is an adventure game. There are no action elements in the game, and the protagonist has no health bar. Each chapter has a time limit, during which Eike has to find a way to prevent the murderer from killing him. This is mainly achieved by traveling through time to different hours, days, years, and even centuries. Obtaining a crucial item, having a conversation with a specific character, or performing another action in the past will prevent Eike from getting killed. Time-traveling requires energy units, which can be found by exploring the town. If Eike fails to achieve the goal at hand within the allotted time and prevent his murder, the chapter must be restarted.
