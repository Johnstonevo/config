Luigi's Won a Mansion! \nThe bad news is that it's crawling with ghosts... and Mario seems to be trapped inside...\n\nLuigi's in for a spooktacular surprise as he creeps into the pitch-dark mansion he won, armed with only a flashlight and a vacuum custom-made for sucking up ghosts. Ghosts lurk in every nook and cranny. You'll have to master the Poltergust 3000 to vacuum them all up! Jewels, coins and cash are hidden throughout the mansion-and finding it all will be worth your while...\n\nYou'll have to solve the mansion's many mysteries to catch a gallery of quirky ghouls, such as the fire-belching Mr. Luggs. Deep inside the mansion hide elusive boss ghosts like Bogmire, each with ghastly powers and a ghostly bone to pick with Luigi!\n\nAfter collecting special medals, you'll be able to shoot fire, water, and ice from your vacuum to unearth secrets and thwart extra-eerie ghosts!
