SEGA RallyÂ® Revo reinvigorates and revolutionizes the genre-defining off-road racing brand with an all-new track deformation system. With this proprietary new technology, players must quickly react to unexpected changes in track conditions on muddy, snow-filled, gravel-covered courses while gunning it at full throttle in their chosen world-renowned, officially licensed rally vehicle. Advanced A.I. pits players against aggressive CPU competitors in the comprehensive single-player campaign, requiring players to dynamically adapt their driving styles. Players will also enjoy heart-pounding rivalry with friends online in a variety of multiplayer split-screen modes for an extremely competitive rally experience.
