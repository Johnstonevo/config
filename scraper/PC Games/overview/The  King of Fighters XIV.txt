Delivering knock-out blows since 1994, the KoF franchise is reinvented in The King of Fighters XIV. For the first time, the visuals have evolved into 3D graphics, yet The King of Fighters XIV manages to keep the classic 2D gameplay and 3-on-3 Team Battle game systems that players expect from this intense and strategic fighting franchise. Battle online in player-vs-player modes or throw a fight fest with the new Party Battle mode.
