Gambler Jiko Chuushinha is a mahjong gambling game based on a manga with the same name. As such, it has a large cast of characters from the comics that the player can choose to compete against. Beyond the manga license, it is very much still a mahjong game, focusing mostly on playing the tile-based board game, though using a difficult variation on the usual rules of the game.
