Power Strike II for the Sega Master System is an overhead shoot-'em-up developed by Compile which acts as a sequel to Power Strike. It is not to be confused with "Power Strike II" for the Game Gear, which despite the identical name, developer and year of release, is an entirely different game, being a localization of GG Aleste II instead.\n\nPower Strike II takes place in an alternative past, fusing 1930s aircraft with futuristic technology seen in other Compile shooters. It was only released in PAL regions.
