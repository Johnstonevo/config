So, I figured out how to get my 8-bit LTTP cover album on the original game via the MSU-1 chip (video calls it defunct, this is not the case. I'd correct it via an annotation if Youtube still supported this function...) The game is freely available to anyone that wants to play it. Experience the game like never before!
