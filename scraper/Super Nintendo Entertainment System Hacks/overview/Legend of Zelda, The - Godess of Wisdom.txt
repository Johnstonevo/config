Goddess of Wisdom features an entirely new story and seems to be set in a different timeline which has provided the developers with a lot of freedom for the plot. The game begins with Link's Uncle racing to save Princess Zelda who was captured by the Council of Wizards; as expected, things go awry, and Link must save Zelda himself.
